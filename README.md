# Spring Boot Microservice Book API with Redis Caching (Dockerized)

This project demonstrates the construction of a scalable Book API using Spring Boot microservices and Docker containers.

# Key Features:

- Microservices Architecture: Built with Spring Boot, the Book API leverages a microservices architecture for independent, easily scalable services. This enables efficient resource allocation and avoids potential bottlenecks.
- API Gateway: An API Gateway serves as the single entry point for API requests, streamlining traffic management. This simplifies load balancing implementation for improved performance under heavy traffic.
- Eureka Server: Service discovery is handled by a dedicated Eureka Server, ensuring efficient communication between microservices and promoting loose coupling.
- Redis Caching: Frequently accessed book data is cached in Redis, significantly reducing database load and enhancing response times, particularly for read-heavy workloads.
- Dockerized Deployment: Docker containers are utilized for packaging and deploying the application. This ensures consistent behavior across diverse environments, facilitating seamless development, testing, and production deployments.

# Learning Outcomes:

This project provides hands-on experience with:

- Building and deploying Spring Boot microservices
- Implementing service discovery with Eureka Server
- Integrating Redis Cache for performance optimization
- Dockerizing applications for consistent delivery
- Potential Use Cases:

This project serves as a foundation for building scalable book management applications, library systems, or any scenario requiring efficient data retrieval and management.
